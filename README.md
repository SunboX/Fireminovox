Fireminovox
===========

A Firefox OS electronic musical instrument

The Fireminovox is inspired by the theremin (originally known as the Ã¦therphone/etherphone, thereminophone or termenvox/thereminvox).

This app senses the relative position of the thereminist's hand and controls oscillators for frequency with the one hand holding the device.

The thereminist can control the frequence using all three axes (x, y and z). Faster moves cause bigger frequency changes.

Press "start" to begin making music and "stop" to finish.
